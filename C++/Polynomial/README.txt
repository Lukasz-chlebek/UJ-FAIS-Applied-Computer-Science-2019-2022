Polynominal implementation using Linked List.
There are operations:
Clear() - clearing polynominal
Push(T& item, int pow) - adding specific element to the polynominal, where item is number before "x" and pow is the power of "x"
horner() - it is algorithm which is finding value of polynominal for specific "x"
and operator +, -, * and << - respectively  addition, substraction, multiplication two polynominals and printing polynominal
